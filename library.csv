0,Why Machines Learn,The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI,['Anil Ananthaswamy'],2024-07-16,481,['Computers'],"A rich, narrative explanation of the mathematics that has brought us machine learning and the ongoing explosion of artificial intelligence Machine learning systems are making life-altering decisions for us: approving mortgage loans, determining whether a tumor is cancerous, or deciding if someone gets bail. They now influence developments and discoveries in chemistry, biology, and physics—the study of genomes, extrasolar planets, even the intricacies of quantum systems. And all this before large language models such as ChatGPT came on the scene. We are living through a revolution in machine learning-powered AI that shows no signs of slowing down. This technology is based on relatively simple mathematical ideas, some of which go back centuries, including linear algebra and calculus, the stuff of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century mathematics. It took the birth and advancement of computer science and the kindling of 1990s computer chips designed for video games to ignite the explosion of AI that we see today. In this enlightening book, Anil Ananthaswamy explains the fundamental math behind machine learning, while suggesting intriguing links between artificial and natural intelligence. Might the same math underpin them both? As Ananthaswamy resonantly concludes, to make safe and effective use of artificial intelligence, we need to understand its profound capabilities and limitations, the clues to which lie in the math that makes machine learning possible.",Why Machines Learn The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI

According to this American anthropologist, 40% of jobs would be useless and could disappear without making any difference. Worse, the stupid jobs could even prove harmful to the economy and the mental health of those who do them.

Dr. Parent has given me very effective methods for working with thoughts and emotions, and for taking the negatives out of the picture.” —Vijay Singh, Masters and PGA Champion By combining classic insights and stories from Zen tradition, Zen Golf helps eliminate the mental distractions that routinely cause poor shots and loss of concentration, allowing golfers to feel in “the zone” that professionals have learned to master.

Zen Golf presents a simple system for building “mental game mastery.” Dr Parent’s unique PAR Approach (focusing on Preparation, Action, and Response to Results) guides golfers with specific techniques for each aspect of their games. In chapters such as “How to Get From the Practice Tee to the First Tee”, “You Produce What You Fear”, and “How to Enjoy a Bad Round of Golf”, the author shares a personal teaching regimen that has helped improve the games of professionals and amateurs alike. Clear, concise, and enlightening, Zen Golf shows golfers how to prepare for, execute, and equally important, respond the results of any golf shot.

8,Summary of The Fourth Turning,by William Strauss & Neil Howe - What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America's Next Rendezvous with Destiny - A Comprehensive Summary,['Alexander Cooper'],2021-03-26,46,['Political Science'],"Summary of The Fourth Turning The Fourth Turning is a book by William Strauss and Neil Howe. It outlines the foundation for what is now known as Strauss-Howe generational theory. The main tenet of the book is that American and global history follows a generational cycle. The cycle is defined by four ""Turnings,” each lasting about 20 years. Generational archetypes play a crucial role in historical events, and these archetypes recur. The cycle of the four ""Turnings"" is called a ""saeculum” and is roughly the length of human life. The book offers a detailed description of the underlying philosophy. The key idea is seasonality. The authors offer their findings from nature and history to claim that the cyclical nature of time permeates all life, including American history. Furthermore, the authors analyze Anglo-American history to find patterns in a generational attitude. They then correlate these characteristics to the historical events of significance. The evidence that the authors present focuses on their interpretation of key historical figures, as well as societal attitudes. The cyclical generational attitudes are the prime factor in analyzing history and politics, according to Strauss and Howe. The authors claim that race, gender, economic class, religion, and political beliefs are all less influential in determining the course of history. This claim is controversial, and authors reflect on their stance against other prominent academics, offering some comparison with several secondary sources. Overall, the evidence that the authors present is highly subjective and is not sufficiently bolstered with verifiable sources. Each generation is presented as having a unified voice, with few acknowledgments of a diversity of thought within each generational group. Therefore, the predictions are not based on solid evidence. Rather, the book puts forward a theory of generational seasonality. The authors explore what this theory could mean, but they do not offer a sufficient basis for their findings.

10,"Humor, Seriously",Why Humor Is a Secret Weapon in Business and Life (And how anyone can harness it. Even you.),"['Jennifer Aaker', 'Naomi Bagdonas']",2021-02-02,274,['Business & Economics'],"WALL STREET JOURNAL, LOS ANGELES TIMES, AND USA TODAY BESTSELLER • Anyone—even you!—can learn how to harness the power of humor in business (and life), based on the popular class at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Don’t miss the authors’ TED Talk, “Why great leaders take humor seriously,” online now. “The ultimate guide to using the magical power of funny as a tool for leadership and a force for good.”—Daniel H. Pink, #1 New York Times bestselling author of When and Drive We are living through a period of unprecedented uncertainty and upheaval in both our personal and professional lives. So it should come as a surprise to exactly no one that trust, human connection, and mental well-being are all on the decline. This may seem like no laughing matter. Yet, the research shows that humor and laughter are among the most valuable tools we have at our disposal for strengthening bonds and relationships, diffusing stress and tension, boosting resilience, and performing when the stakes are high. That’s why Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas teach the popular course Humor: Serious Business at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where they help some of the world’s most hard-driving, blazer-wearing business minds infuse more humor and levity into their work and lives. In Humor, Seriously, they draw on findings by behavioral scientists, world-class comedians, and inspiring business leaders to reveal how humor works and—more important—how you can use more of it, better. Aaker and Bagdonas unpack the theory and application of humor: what makes something funny, how to mine your life for material, and simple ways to identify and leverage your unique humor style. They show how to use humor to rebuild vital connections; appear more confident, competent, and authentic at work; and foster cultures where levity and creativity can thrive. President Dwight David Eisenhower once said, “A sense of humor is part of the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done.” If Dwight David Eisenhower, the second least naturally funny president (after Franklin Pierce), thought humor was necessary to win wars, build highways, and warn against the military-industrial complex, then you might consider learning it too.","Humor, Seriously Why Humor Is a Secret Weapon in Business and Life (And how anyone can harness it.

11,How the World Ran Out of Everything,Inside the Global Supply Chain,['Peter S. Goodman'],2024-06-11,400,['Business & Economics'],"By the New York Times’s Global Economics Correspondent, an extraordinary journey to understand the worldwide supply chain—exposing both the fascinating pathways of manufacturing and transportation that bring products to your doorstep, and the ruthless business logic that has left local communities at the mercy of a complex and fragile network for their basic necessities. ""A tale that will change how you look at the world."" —Mark Leibovich One of Foreign Policy's ""Most Anticipated Books of 2024"" How does the wealthiest country on earth run out of protective gear in the middle of a public health catastrophe? How do its parents find themselves unable to locate crucially needed infant formula? How do its largest companies spend billions of dollars making cars that no one can drive for a lack of chips? The last few years have radically highlighted the intricacy and fragility of the global supply chain. Enormous ships were stuck at sea, warehouses overflowed, and delivery trucks stalled. The result was a scarcity of everything from breakfast cereal to medical devices, from frivolous goods to lifesaving necessities. And while the scale of the pandemic shock was unprecedented, it underscored the troubling reality that the system was fundamentally at risk of descending into chaos all along. And it still is. Sabotaged by financial interests, loss of transparency in markets, and worsening working conditions for the people tasked with keeping the gears turning, our global supply chain has become perpetually on the brink of collapse. In How the World Ran Out of Everything, award-winning journalist Peter S. Goodman reveals the fascinating innerworkings of our supply chain and the factors that have led to its constant, dangerous vulnerability. His reporting takes readers deep into the elaborate system, showcasing the triumphs and struggles of the human players who operate it—from factories in Asia and an almond grower in Northern California, to a group of striking railroad workers in Texas, to a truck driver who Goodman accompanies across hundreds of miles of the Great Plains. Through their stories, Goodman weaves a powerful argument for reforming a supply chain to become truly reliable and resilient, demanding a radical redrawing of the bargain between labor and shareholders, and deeper attention paid to how we get the things we need. From one of the most respected economic journalists working today, How the World Ran Out of Everything is a fiercely smart, deeply informative look at how our supply chain operates, and why its reform is crucial—not only to avoid dysfunction in our day to day lives, but to protect the fate of our global fortunes.",How the World Ran Out of Everything Inside the Global Supply Chain
